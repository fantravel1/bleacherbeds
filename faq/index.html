            <h3>How far is the facility from the stadium?</h3>
            <p>Every BleacherBeds facility is within walking distance of the venue (typically 5-20 minutes on foot). The exact distance and walk time are shown on the facility page and the map.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the walking route like at night?</h3>
            <p>We verify that walking routes are safe and well-lit. Facility pages include walking safety information and recommended routes. Always travel in groups when possible, especially late at night.</p>

        <!-- Closest Real Bed -->
        <div class="faq-category">
          <h2>The Closest Real Bed</h2>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the "Closest Real Bed"?</h3>
            <p>Every BleacherBeds event listing includes one "Closest Real Bed" option: the single nearest traditional lodging (hotel, hostel, or legal short-term rental). This gives you the closest option to the venue, whether you prefer traditional or overflow lodging. See our <a href="/closest-bed/">Closest Bed page</a> for more.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why do you include the closest hotel if you're a competitor?</h3>
            <p>Because our mission is to give fans the closest possible bed to their event—not just the cheapest overflow bed. Some fans prefer traditional hotels, and we think everyone deserves to know their actual closest option.</p>
