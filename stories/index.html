          </div>
          <div class="story-content">
            <p>"My family saved for three years to attend the Super Bowl. We got tickets, but hotel prices were insane—$700+ a night. We were about to give up when we found BleacherBeds.</p>
            <p>For $120 a night, we got clean dorm rooms 8 minutes from Arrowhead Stadium. Our kids had their own beds, there were showers, bathrooms, security staff everywhere. It was safe, close, and affordable. We were able to attend the game AND have a real place to sleep without breaking the bank."</p>

            <p>I was nervous about a converted gym, but it was SO much better than I expected. Clean beds, real bathrooms, helpful security staff. My son felt safe, I felt safe, and we saved $1,000+ for the weekend. We'll definitely use BleacherBeds again."</p>
