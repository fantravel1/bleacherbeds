## 🏟️ Overview

**BleacherBeds™** is a global platform for **ultra-close, ultra-temporary lodging** designed specifically for **fans traveling to major events**.

When hotels sell out or surge in price, BleacherBeds unlocks **safe, legal, brand-safe overflow lodging**—right beside the venue.

This is not “sleep anywhere.”  
This is not couch-surfing.  
This is **professional, fan-first, event overflow lodging**.

---

## 🎯 Core Idea

Most fans want one thing:

**The closest possible place to sleep after the event.**

BleacherBeds solves that with a hard rule:

### ⭐ Every event listing must include:
- **ONE “Closest Real Bed” option**  
  (closest hotel, hostel, or legal Airbnb/short-term rental)

AND

- **BleacherBeds overflow options**  
  (temporary sleeping inventory within walking distance)

---
