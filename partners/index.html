    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="partner-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Partnership FAQ</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much capacity do I need?</h3>
          <p>There's no minimum. We work with facilities of all sizes—from 10 beds to 1,000+. Smaller facilities can still generate meaningful revenue during major events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What about liability and insurance?</h3>
          <p>Partners must carry business liability insurance. We provide guidance on coverage needs. BleacherBeds provides additional insurance on top of yours, but you maintain primary responsibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I operate the facility differently outside of BleacherBeds partnerships?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Your facility is yours. Partner with us on specific dates while using the space for other purposes the rest of the time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What if a guest damages my facility?</h3>
          <p>We screen guests carefully and enforce behavior standards. If damage occurs, you report it and we handle liability determination and claims management.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How often would I be booked?</h3>
          <p>That depends on your location and facility type. Major event cities see bookings 5-20+ times per year. Smaller markets might see 2-5 bookings annually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I choose which events to participate in?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You control your calendar. Accept bookings for events that work for you; decline others. You have full flexibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do you handle taxes?</h3>
          <p>We provide 1099s for all partnership revenue. You're responsible for your own tax reporting and obligations.</p>
